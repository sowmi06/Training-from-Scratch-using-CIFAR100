# Training from Scratch using CIFAR100

- The deep convolution neural network (DNCC) is built with 6 convolution layers and with different learning rates for different convolution layers in the network.

- The following are the parameters used DCNN network model :
    - Images input size = (64, 64, 3)
    - Optimizer = Adam
    - Batch size = 128
    - Epochs = 100
    - Kernel size = (3, 3)
